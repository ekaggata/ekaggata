One should never eat any amount of foods touched by mold. Even it has just a tiny patch of mold. Even if it's a slice of bread (or whatever) taken from the same package with a mold-touched slice but looking perfectly clean. Even if you toast it. It still can has serious chances of being contaminated with mycotoxins that can cause chronic fatigue, infetility and other health issues. But this doesn't apply to mold found on the kinds of cheese meant to contain it.
