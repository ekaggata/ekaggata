![Amanita Phalloides]({{ site.url }}/assets/postpics/amanita_phalloides.jpg)
Amanita Phalloides mushrooms are deadly poisonous and eating even a humble piece (like Â¼ of a cap or even less) of it will probably kill you (your liver, and there is no antidote known) yet, contrary to a popular belief, you are probably going to be Ok if you touch it and lick your fingers. Even if you lick the mushroom itself you probably aren't going to need a liver transplant. But don't try this at home (or in the woods), seriously, that's a kind of fact one should better avoid checking.
